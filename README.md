# pytorch-image-classification
An image classifier using pytorch

#### This is based on the lectures by *Sung Kim's* youtube channel

People prefer to work in pytorch because it is more pythonic( easy to debug, simple and flexible code) and neural networkic(it is coded as to how the neural network works) and also easy to work with GPUs.

We can create a virtual environment in Anaconda(refer to online tutorials) and install all the libraries required for this project.

1. Pytorch
  Use the command   conda install -c pytorch pytorch
  Check for a successfull installation using
  import torch
  torch.__version.__
  You should get a proper version number like 1.3.1
  Before trying the Notebooks, we need to verify the following things:
  
  1.Open a jupyter Notebook and see if you can import torch, if you get any import errors, you need to    debug this first.If you dont get an error, you may continue.
  If you get an error, try installig jupyter notebook in the same environment,

We will start by creating simple projects in pytorch.Check the jupyter notebooks given.
